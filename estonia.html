        <h2>History and Food</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Estonia is a country situated in Eastern Europe, on the edge of the Baltic Sea. Its two border countries are Latvia and Russia, both of which influence the existing culture and traditions of the country. My favorite thing about visiting Estonia is how distincntly unique it is to other European countries. Due to its Soviet past, its small towns and villages hold a significant amount of history and culture. One of the most popular sites for tourists and my personal favorite is Old Town in Tallin, the capital of Estonia. Old Town is home to a wonderful bustling farmers market and showcases the beautiful rustic architecture that is central to Baltic traditions.</p>

          <p>Similar to Greece, Estonia offers a variety of unique cuisine options that every tourist should try if they have the opportunity to visit the country. Much of its food culture stems from Danish, Finnish, and Russian influences, and take from Mediterranean and European-inspired foods. For example, some of Estonia's most popular dishes include:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Pork and potato salad</li>
            <li>Verivorst, or blood sausage</li>
            <li>Lamb and rhubarb</li>
            <li>Estonian cheese</li>
          </ul>
