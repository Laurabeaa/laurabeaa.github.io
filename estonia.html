        <h2>History and Culture</h2>
        <article>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia">Estonia</a> is a country situated in Eastern Europe, on the edge of the Baltic Sea. It is surrounded by countries such as Latvia and Russia, both of which influence the existing culture and traditions of the country. the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, in Tallinn is a popular, decorated Russian cathedral that attracts a large amount of visiting tourists, particularly those interested in religious architecture. <em>(Text source by: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia">Wikipedia</a>.

          <p>My favorite thing about visiting Estonia is how distincntly unique it is to other European countries. Due to its Soviet past, its small towns and villages hold a significant amount of history and culture.</p>
          
          <p>One of the most popular sites for tourists and my personal favorite is Old Town in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Old Town is home to a wonderful bustling farmers' market and showcases the beautiful rustic architecture that is central to Baltic traditions.</p>
          
          <p>Another one of my favorite things to see in Estonia is the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Tallinn, a cathedral heavily inspired by Russian Orthodox religious architecture.</p>

         <h2>Food and Diversity in Estonia</h2> 
         <article>
         <p>Estonia is culturally diverse, home to a variety of ethnic groups. As a result of this population distribution, Estonia is filled with tourists and locals from all around the world. My favorite thing about visiting a diverse country like Estonia is having the opportunity to learn more about people's backgrounds, history, and languages. Within Estonia, ethnic groups are divided as such:</p>  
         
         <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Ethnic Group</th>
              <th>Population (in <abbr title="pct">pct</abbr>)</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Estonian</td>
              <td>69.1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Russian</td>
              <td>23.7</td>
              </tr>
          
            <tr>
              <td>Ukranian</td>
              <td>2.1</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Other</td>
              <td>4.6</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Unspecified</td>
              <td>0.5</td>
            </tr>

          </table>  

          <p>Similar to Greece, Estonia offers a variety of unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia#Cuisine">cuisine options</a> that every tourist should try if they have the opportunity to visit the country. Much of its food culture stems from Danish, Finnish, and Russian influences, and take from Mediterranean and European-inspired foods. For example, some of Estonia's most popular dishes include:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Pork and potato salad</li>
            <li>Lamb dishes</li>
            <li>Estonian vastlakukkel, or bread with paste</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition to the above, Estonia's cuisine largely depends on local farming and season specific availability of foods.<em> (Text source by: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia">Wikipedia.</a> Attribution: site page last edited by user MylowattsIam.
