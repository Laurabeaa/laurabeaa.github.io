         <h2>Favorite Cities in Greece</h2> 
         <article>
         <h3>Mykonos</h3> 
         <p>Of all the cities in Greece, my two favorite are Mykonos and Athens. Mykonos is a beautiful island located in the Aegean Sea that is well-known for its white architecture and beautiful beaches. The small and friendly atmosphere of the island makes it a very relaxing place, and I personally love being able to check out the multitude of small businesses that many island dwellers depend on for income on the island. Because Mykonos largely depends on tourism for its economoc prosperity, the island attracts a variety of people from all across the world. As someone who loves meetign new people, I loved having the opportunity to connect with a variety of cultures while on vacation.</p>  
         
         <p> In addition, Mykonos is comprised of a multitude of enrinching food options for all foodies! I love trying new cuisines, and while I was there, I was able to try things I had never tried before. Some of the best foods on Mykonos include:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Kopanisti, a spicy and soft cheese</li>
          <li>Greek sausage</li>
          <li>Fresh-caught fish</li>
          <li>Melopita, a sweet pie with cheese and honey</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Athens</h3>
          <p> As a history enthusiast, Athens is one of my favorite cities in Greece because of its incredibly enriching history. One of the most famous tourist attractions is the Parthenon, A greek temple that is housed on Acropolis in Athens. It is a temple that was constructed in the fifth century as a dedication to the Greek goddess Athena.</p>
