        <h2>Favorite Things to do in Greece</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Greece is a wonderful vacation spot and one of my favorites! In particular, I love that I am able to do a variety of activities, especially water-related adventures like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>swimming in the Mediterranean sea</li>
              <li>boating</li>
              <li>kayaking</li>
              <li>jet skiing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of all these activities, I personally loved boating! The vast availability of sea surrounding Greece makes it incredibly fun to hop around different islands and experience a very cold, but refreshing plunge into seawater. The most interesting experience I had with boating was actually the process to get situated onto the boat. Due to the windy enviornment in Greece (especially in the summer when I visited), sea currents are often choppy and so captains usually drive boats out into the water without passengers first, and the passengers are then taken onto the boat from the dock in a smaller vessel.</p>

         <h2>Favorite Places in Greece</h2> 
         <article>
         <h3>Mykonos</h3> 
         <p>Mykonos is a beautiful island located in the Aegean Sea that is well-known for its white architecture and beautiful beaches. The small and friendly atmosphere of the island makes it a very relaxing place, and I personally love being able to check out the multitude of small businesses that many island dwellers depend on for income on the island. Through their businesses, island dwellers create and sell handmade jewelrey, clothes, and trinkets that beautifully represent the island. Because Mykonos largely depends on tourism for its economoc prosperity, the island attracts a variety of people from all across the world. As someone who loves meeting new people, I enjoyed connecting with a variety of cultures while on vacation.</p>  
         
         <p> In addition, Mykonos is comprised of a multitude of enrinching food options for all foodies! I love trying new foods, and while I was there I was able to taste dishes ranging from lamb to authentic Greek salads and stuffed eggplant. My favorite thing about trying new dishes is being able to leave with a potential new recipe to try at home! Some of the best foods on Mykonos include:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Kopanisti, a spicy and soft cheese</li>
          <li>Greek sausage and beef stew</li>
          <li>Octopus, and other fresh-caught fish</li>
          <li>Melopita, a sweet pie with cheese and honey</li>
          <li>Souvlaki, or Greek gyros</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Athens</h3>
          <p>As a history enthusiast, Athens is one of my favorite cities in Greece because of its incredibly enriching history. In particular, Athens is home to a vairety of mythological temples that honor Greek gods and goddesses from Greek culture. Some temples you can find across Athens include:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Temple of Hephaestus</li>
              <li>Theatre of Herodes Atticus</li>
              <li>Temple of Poseidon</li>
              <li>Acropolis</li>
            </ul>
            
          <p>One of the most famous tourist attractions is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, a greek temple that is housed on Acropolis in Athens. It is a temple that was constructed in the fifth century as a dedication to the Greek goddess Athena. In addition, Athens is considered the birthplace of democracy in historical terms; as a result, there are a variety of wonderful museums to check out that shed light on the important development of democratic government in the world. One example of a personal favorite museum of mine in Athens is the National Archaeological Museum.</p>
