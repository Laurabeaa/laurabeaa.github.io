         <h3>Top Two Favorite Travel Locations</h3>  
         <p>I have been traveling since <time datetime="2002">2002</time> when I first moved to Florida, where I reside now, from Buenos Aires, Argentina at the mere age of two. Since then, my family and I have visited approximately 20 countries, most of which are loctated in the Carribean and the European continent.</p>
            
         <p>Despite all the places I have visited, I particularly enjoy traveling to places with profound cultural history. As a result, my top two favorite places I have visited are:</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>Greece</li>
            <li>Estonia</li>
          </ul>
