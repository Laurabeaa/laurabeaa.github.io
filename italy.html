      <h2>Introduction to Italy</h2>

      <article>
       <p>Italy became a nation-state in <time datetime="1861">1861</time> when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor Emmanuel II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito Mussolini established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. 
       <p>A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in <time datetime="1946">1946</time> and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of <abbr>NATO</abbr> and the European Economic Community, and its subsequent successors the <abbr>EC</abbr> and the <abbr>EU</abbr>. It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>
            
       <p>Nonetheless, Italy faces its own set of challenges. Persistent problems include:</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>Sluggish economic growth</li>
            <li>High youth and female unemployment</li>
            <li>Organized crime</li>
            <li>Corruption</li>
            <li>Economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north</li>
